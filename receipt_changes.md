# FarmaBot Receipt System Changes

## Changes Overview

We've simplified the checkout process by replacing PDF receipt generation with a straightforward text-based receipt system. This change makes the application easier to deploy and eliminates the need for external storage solutions like Google Cloud Storage.

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Removed PDF Generation**
   - Removed the `generate_receipt_pdf()` function that was generating PDF files
   - Eliminated all ReportLab PDF generation code and imports
   - Removed references to PDF file paths in receipt messages

2. **Implemented Text Receipts**
   - Added a simple text-based receipt format with:
     - Order number (UUID)
     - Timestamp
     - Itemized list of purchases
     - Total amount
   - Added different formatting for English and Spanish receipts

3. **Removed Cloud Storage Dependencies**
   - Removed the StorageService initialization and import
   - Eliminated Google Cloud Storage references
   - Removed storage_service parameter from receipt generation

4. **Fixed Store Service Issues**
   - Updated the StoreService methods to directly query the database
   - Added proper multilingual support for store information
   - Fixed parameter mismatch issues between services

## Benefits:

1. **Simplified Architecture**: The application is now simpler and has fewer dependencies
2. **Easier Deployment**: No need to set up Google Cloud credentials or storage buckets
3. **Reduced Cost**: No cloud storage costs for PDF files
4. **Immediate Receipts**: Users get their receipt information immediately in the chat

## How to Deploy:

The application can now be deployed to Hugging Face Spaces without any additional configuration. Simply push the code to your Hugging Face repository, and the text-based receipt system will work without additional setup.
